# Welcome to my Project
# Wireless-speaker-rating
Wireless speakers are loudspeakers that receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. The two most popular RF frequencies that support audio transmission to wireless loudspeakers include a variation of WiFi, while others depend on Bluetooth to transmit audio data to the receiving speaker.
